# Development

bin2coe uses the [Hatch] project manager ([installation instructions][hatch-install]).

Hatch automatically manages dependencies and runs testing, type checking, and other operations in isolated [environments][hatch-environments].

[Hatch]: https://hatch.pypa.io/
[hatch-install]: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/
[hatch-environments]: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/environment/

## Testing

You can run the tests on your local machine with:

```bash
hatch test
```

The [`test` command][hatch-test] supports options such as `-c` for measuring test coverage, `-a` for testing with a matrix of Python versions, and appending an argument like `tests/test_shell.py::test_shell_can_override_defaults` for running a single test.

## Type checking

You can run the [mypy static type checker][mypy] with:

```bash
hatch run types:check
```

[mypy]: https://mypy-lang.org/

## Formatting and linting

You can run the [Ruff][ruff] formatter and linter with:

```bash
hatch fmt
```

This will automatically make [safe fixes][fix-safety] to your code. If you want to only check your files without making modifications, run `hatch fmt --check`.

## Packaging

You can use [`hatch build`][hatch-build] to create build artifacts, a [source distribution ("sdist")][sdist] and a [built distribution ("wheel")][bdist].

You can use [`hatch publish`][hatch-publish] to publish build artifacts to [PyPI][pypi].

[hatch-build]: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/build/
[sdist]: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist
[bdist]: https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/glossary/#term-Built-Distribution
[hatch-publish]: https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/publish/
[pypi]: https://pypi.org/

## Continuous integration

Testing, type checking, and formatting/linting is [checked in CI][ci].
